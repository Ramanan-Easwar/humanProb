Given the list of human tracked by id and their corresponding key-points, this model predicts that the particular element keyed by id is indeed a human.
The keypoints results are based on OpenPose Pose Estimation software.
A humanProb of 0.9 < denotes that the element is indeed a human and < 0.1
means it is not.
